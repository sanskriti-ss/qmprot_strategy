# QMProt: A Comprehensive Dataset of Quantum Properties for Proteins

This repository is made as supporting material for the paper "QMProt: A Comprehensive Dataset of Quantum Properties for Proteins".

### Abstract
We introduce Quantum Mechanics for Proteins (QMProt), a dataset developed to support quantum computing applications in protein research. QMProt contains precise quantum-mechanical and physicochemical data, enabling accurate characterization of biomolecules and supporting advanced computational methods like molecular fragmentation and reassembly. The dataset includes 45 molecules covering all 20 essential human amino acids and their core structural elements: amino terminal groups, carboxyl terminal groups, alpha carbons, and unique side chains. QMProt primarily
features organic molecules with up to 15 non-hydrogen atoms (C, N, O, S), offering comprehensive molecular Hamiltonians, ground state energies, and detailed physicochemical properties. Publicly accessible, QMProt aims to enhance reproducibility and advance quantum-enhanced simulations in molecular biology, biochemistry, and drug discovery.

### Structure of the Repository

This repository contains two main folders:

- Quantum Strategy for the Simulation of Large Proteins: This folder contains the material supporting the research on quantum resource estimation for simulating fragmented biomolecules such as amino acids and peptides. It contributes to assessing the scalability and fault-tolerant feasibility of simulating large biomolecules through fragmentation and reassembly, as detailed in the associated paper: "Quantum Strategy for the Simulation of Large Proteins: From Fragmentation in Small Proteins to Scalability in Complex Systems"
Parfait Atchade-Adelomou & Laia Coronas Sala (2025).

- QMProt Hamiltonians and Energies:This folder contains the code used to simulate the molecules in the QMProt dataset, including the computation of Hamiltonians, energy estimations, and generation of the plots presented in the main paper.
